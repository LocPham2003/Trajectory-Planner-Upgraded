Things left to do
- Implement Bezier curves.
- Implement saving/ loading splines.
- Implement parameterization of the splines (https://www.cs.helsinki.fi/group/goa/mallinnus/curves/curves.html)
- Implement misc data such as time, velocity, acceleration in a toolbar as utilities.
- Optimize spline interpolation for point manipulation.
